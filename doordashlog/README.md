# DoorDash Log App

## This application allows you to add dashes and summarize the data to easily know how much you made during each dash
### Live app: https://doordash-log.herokuapp.com/
### * The 'Add Dash' button allows you to add a single dash (A dash consists of multiple orders)
### * The table below contains all dashes you have made
### * The summary at the top shows your totals and calculates your net pay by subtracting out wear and tear + gas cost

#### - Wear and Tear is currently calculated for a small sedan (from itstillruns.com) as $2,560 annually for 15,000 miles driven for about $0.17 per mile in wear and tear
#### - I added an extra $0.02 for a $90 oil change every 5,000 miles for a grand total of $0.19 per mile in costs to be very conservative
