## DoorDash Log
### I wanted to create a react app that helped me log my door dash deliveries.  It records and calculates financial metrics to determine how well you are performing as a dash driver.

## Mint Fold Transaction Upload
### After getting a fold card I found out that it does not connect to my favorite budgeting tool, Mint.  I decided to write some script using Selenium to take the transaction csv from Fold and input them into Mint.  The script compares your Fold csv to the master list of already added transactions (to Mint) and then adds any new ones to your Mint account.  All you need to do is update the 'username' and 'password' to your personal account for it to work.
#### I have included some sample transactions in a fold csv and master fold csv.
